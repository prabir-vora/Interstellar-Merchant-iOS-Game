# Interstellar-Merchant-iOS-Game
A game I developed for a class project at Georgia Tech. It involves going to different planets in various solar systems to trade goods and make profits. Each planet has a unique ecosystem with random goods and prices based on their Tech Level and Resource abundance.

Some additional features include buying new spaceships and fuel to continue traveling.
